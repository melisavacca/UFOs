# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to make some adjustments and edits to a webpage and table.  I helped Dana provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.  We originally just had "date" as a filter, but we added filters for city, state, country, and shape as well.  Webpage users are able to use one single filter or multiple at the same time, depending on their preference.  


## Results

Users can use the filter options on the left of the page to filter by date, city, state, country, and shape.  The image below shows the data table unfiltered.

Users can use one filter at a time if they are focusing on one variable.  Once users type in what they want to filter, they just need to press enter and the table will show the filtered data.  Below is an image of the data showing UFO sightings just in California.

Users can also use every filter at once, as well.  Below is an example of all UFO sightings on 1/1/2010 in El Cajon, CA with a triangle shape.

Users just need to erase filters to reset and perform another search. 


## Summary

- One Drawback of This Webpage
  I think the major drawback of the webpage as it currently stands is that we cannot filter by duration of sighting or keywords in the comments.  Adding these filters would be
  simple, and I think some users would be interested in this. 
  
- Additional Recommendations 
  Besides adding the additional filters, I would reccomend adjusting the puncuation in the table to make cities, states, and countries capitalized when necessary.  
  Since all of this data occurs in January of 2010, I would reccomend getting updated data as well as data from a different month of the year to compare.
